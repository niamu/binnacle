# Binnacle

Binnacle contains all of your image assets within a hash-map. Images as data that can be manipulated and used in your website to keep asset requests to a minimum and data always immediately accessible. Rather than keeping different versions of your images with various colour options or rotation/flip transformations, now keep a single reference image that you can manipulate the way you manipulate the rest of your data within your app.
